-------------------------------------------------FINDINGS-----------------------------------------------------------------
->6. Example findings
Finding 1
Title: Otdated OpenSSH server on port 22
Risk/Severity: High
Description: The SSH server version running on the host is outdated and has known vulnerabilities which may allow remote exploitation.
Evidence: (Include screenshot filename or report excerpt)
Recommended fix: Update OpenSSH to the latest vendor-supplied version, disable root login over SSH, enforce key-based authentication, and apply firewall rules to limit SSH access.
->Finding 2
Title: SMB (Server Message Block) anonymous access or outdated SMB version
Risk/Severity: High
Description: SMB service responds and allows anonymous enumeration or uses SMBv1 which is insecure.
Evidence: (Include screenshot filename or report excerpt)
Recommended fix: Disable SMBv1, require authentication, apply latest security patches, and restrict SMB access to trusted hosts.
->Finding 3
Title: Missing OS security updates / unpatched vulnerabilities
Risk/Severity: Medium/High (depending on CVE)
Description: Multiple installed packages have known vulnerabilities (CVE references listed in report).
Evidence: (Include screenshot filename or report excerpt)
Recommended fix: Apply vendor-supplied updates and patches; configure automatic updates where appropriate.
->Finding 4
Title: Open HTTP service (port 80) with directory listing enabled
Risk/Severity: Medium
Description: Web server lists directories or exposes sensitive files.
Evidence: (Include screenshot)
Recommended fix: Disable directory listing, restrict file permissions, review exposed endpoints, and enforce HTTPS.
->Finding 5
Title: Weak TLS configuration or self-signed certificates
Risk/Severity: Medium
Description: TLS uses weak ciphers or expired/self-signed certificates.
Evidence: (Include screenshot)
Recommended fix: Configure strong TLS ciphers, obtain a valid certificate from a trusted CA, and disable deprecated protocols (SSLv3, TLS1.0).

7. Prioritised remediation plan (example):
8. Immediately patch/upgrade services identified as Critical and High severity.
9. Disable or restrict network services not required (close unused ports).
10. Harden configurations: SSH (disable root login), SMB (disable v1), web servers (disable directory listing, enable HTTPS), etc.
11. Enable and configure host firewall rules to limit service exposure to trusted networks
12. Schedule regular scans and enable automatic security updates where feasible.
13. Keep a record of applied fixes and re-scan to verify remediation.
-------------------------------------------Conclusion---------------------------------------------------------------------------
This vulnerability scan provided an introductory assessment of the local PC and revealed areas for improvement. The most critical issues (listed above) should be addressed first. After remediation, re-run the scan to confirm that vulnerabilities have been resolved.
