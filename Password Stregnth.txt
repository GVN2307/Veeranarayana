-------------------------------------------Tools Used----------------------------------------------------------------
*Online Password Strength Checker (e.g., passwordmeter.com, security.org)
--------------------------------------------Experimentation & Results------------------------------------------------
I created five distinct passwords with varying levels of complexity, ranging from simple dictionary words to complex strings. I tested each one to observe how the score changed.

*Weak** | `password123` | Low (Common word + sequence) | **Very Weak.** Instantly crackable. Found in common leak databases. 
*Basic** | `Summer2024` | Low-Medium (Word + Date) | **Weak.** Susceptible to dictionary attacks. Predictable pattern.
*Modified** | `Svmmer!2024` | Medium (Substitutions applied) | **Fair.** Better than basic, but standard substitutions (v for u) are easily guessed by algorithms.

**Complex** | `X9#mP2$vL!q` | High (Random characters) | **Strong.** High entropy. Hard to memorize but very secure.
**Passphrase** | `Correct-Horse-Battery-Staple` | Very High (Long sentence) | **Very Strong.** Excellent length (25+ chars). Immune to brute force due to length, though dictionary words are used.

----------------------------Observations & Feedback Analysis---------------------------------------------------------
Based on the tool feedback, I noted the following behaviors:
* **Length is Critical:** Adding characters increased the score more significantly than adding symbols. A 15-character password was often rated stronger than an 8-character complex password.
* **Predictability Penalties:** The tools penalized common patterns like "123" at the end, or starting with a capital letter (e.g., "Password").
* **Dictionary Words:** Passwords containing whole words (e.g., "Summer") were flagged as vulnerable to dictionary attacks, even with numbers attached.

------------------------------Research: Common Password Attacks--------------------------------------------------------

### A. Brute Force Attack
* **Definition:** An attack where a hacker uses software to try every possible combination of characters (A-Z, 0-9, symbols) until the correct one is found.
* **Defense:** Increasing password length is the best defense. Because the number of combinations grows exponentially with every added character, a long password makes brute forcing mathematically impossible within a human lifetime.

### B. Dictionary Attack
* **Definition:** An attack that uses a pre-defined list (a "dictionary") of common words, phrases, and commonly used passwords to guess credentials. It is much faster than brute force because it doesn't try random gibberish.
* **Defense:** Avoid using standard words found in the dictionary. Using random character strings or misspelling words intentionally helps defeat this.

---------------------------------Best Practices & Tips Learned-----------------------------------------------

1.  **Length over Complexity:** A passphrase (4 random words) is often easier to remember and harder to crack than a short, complex string like `P@55w0rd`. Target 12+ characters.
2.  **Avoid PII:** Never use Personal Identifiable Information (Birthdays, Pet Names, Surnames) as these can be found via social engineering.
3.  **Unique Passwords:** Never reuse the same password across multiple sites. If one site is breached, all accounts become vulnerable (Credential Stuffing).
4.  **Use a Password Manager:** Since "Strong" passwords like `X9#mP2$vL!q` are impossible to remember, a password manager is essential to store them securely.
5.  **Enable MFA:** Multi-Factor Authentication adds a layer of security that protects the account even if the password is stolen.

--------------------------------Conclusion: Complexity vs. Security--------------------------------------------------------
This experiment confirms that password complexity directly correlates to security, but **length is the multiplier**. Complexity (adding symbols/numbers) increases the "alphabet" an attacker must guess from, but Length increases the exponential difficulty of the guess.

A short complex password is weak. A long simple password is weak. A **long and complex** password (or a long passphrase) provides the mathematical entropy required to resist modern computing power in brute force attacks.
