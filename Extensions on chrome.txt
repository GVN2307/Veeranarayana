------------------------------------------------------------Tools Used-----------------------------------------------------------------------
* **Browser:** Google Chrome (Version 120.0) / Mozilla Firefox
* **Interface:** Browser Extensions Manager (`chrome://extensions`)

-----------------------------------------------------------Procedure & Steps Taken-----------------------------------------------------------

1.  **Accessing Manager:** I navigated to the browser settings menu, selected "Extensions," and chose "Manage Extensions" to view the full list of installed add-ons.
2.  **Audit Process:** I reviewed the list specifically looking for:
    * Extensions I did not remember installing.
    * Extensions that haven't been used in over 6 months.
    * Extensions labeled "Corrupted" or those removed from the Web Store by the developer.
3.  **Permission Check:** For every active extension, I checked the "Details" to see if the permissions matched the functionality (e.g., a calculator app shouldn't need access to "Read and change all data on all websites").
4.  **Removal:** I removed the identified suspicious extensions and cleared the browsing data.
5.  **Verification:** I restarted the browser to ensure the extensions were gone and to check for performance improvements.

------------------------------------------------Findings: Suspicious Extensions Identified---------------------------------------------------

During the audit, I identified and removed the following extensions:

**"Free PDF Converter Tool"** | Removed | Unrecognized/Adware behavior. Search engine kept changing to Yahoo unexpectedly. | **High Risk.** Requested "Read and change data on all websites" despite just being a converter. |
**"Super Coupon Finder"** | Removed | Suspicious. Pop-up ads were appearing frequently on shopping sites. | **Medium Risk.** Tracked browsing history on unrelated e-commerce sites. |
**"Dark Mode Everywhere"** | Removed | Unnecessary. Browser now has native dark mode support. | **Low Risk.** Not malicious, but outdated and unused code slows down the browser. |

----------------------------------------------------Research: Risks of Malicious Extensions-------------------------------------------------------

Based on my research for this task, malicious extensions can harm users in three primary ways:

### A. Data Theft & Keylogging
Some malicious extensions quietly record keystrokes to steal login credentials (usernames/passwords) or credit card numbers when the user shops online.

### B. Browser Hijacking
These extensions forcibly change the default search engine (e.g., from Google to a fake search site) or the homepage to generate advertising revenue for the attacker. They often prevent the user from changing the settings back.

### C. Ad Injection (Adware)
Extensions can inject unwanted advertisements into legitimate websites. This not only ruins the user experience but can also lead users to click on phishing links or download further malware.

------------------------------------------------------Conclusion & Best Practices------------------------------------------------------------------------

After removing the suspicious extensions and restarting the browser, I noticed a slight improvement in loading speeds and the search engine settings remained stable.

**Key Takeaways:**
* **Principle of Least Privilege:** Only install extensions that are absolutely necessary.
* **Check Source:** Only download extensions from official stores (Chrome Web Store/Firefox Add-ons) and check the developer's reputation.
* **Review Permissions:** If a simple extension asks for "Full Access" to your data, do not install it.
* **Regular Audits:** Monthly checks of installed extensions are necessary to maintain browser hygiene.
